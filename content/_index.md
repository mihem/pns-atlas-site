        This is the corresponding website to the publication [Multi-omic characterization of human sural nerves across polyneuropathies](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.12.05.627043v1).

        We present a large scale single cell transcriptional and spatial atlas of human peripheral nerves in health and disease (polyneuropathies).
        Interactive visualizations of the single nuclei sural nerve dataset and the spatial transcriptomics data (Xenium) can be found below.

        The code used for the analysis can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/mihem/sural_atlas).
        The raw sequencing will be available in [GEO](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE) soon.
